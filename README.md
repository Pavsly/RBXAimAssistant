# RBXAimAssistant
Soft-locking aim-bot that can either be used as an assistant or outright lock-on tool. Feel free to contribute.
## Description
This script was created with care for [**Synapse X**](https://x.synapse.to/) & [**Script-Ware**](https://script-ware.com/), though it is expected to work on many other execution platforms. Projects like this call for more compatibility, that's why I'm supporting **https://scriptunc.org/** to tell you guys that it's essential that we all have a unified naming convention to stick to for not only compatibility but for readability.
